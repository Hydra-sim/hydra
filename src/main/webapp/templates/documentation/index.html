    <h3 id="info-simulations">1. Simulation</h3>
    <p>Here you can find information and instructions on how to use the simulation tool, and how the result works.</p>
    <img src="img/tabs.png" alt="tabs" width="500px" style="float: right;">

    <p>In the simulations tab you can see a list of all previous simulation.
        Click on simulation name to view simulation results. You can also delete, edit, share and set password on the
        simulations.
        Passwords are set by clicking on the "lock-icon", and are used to prevent other users of the system to change
        your simulation.</p>

    <h3 id="info-timetables">2. Timetables</h3>
    <img src="img/newtimetable.png" alt=" new timetable" width="250px" style="float: right;">
    <p>In the timetables tab you can see a list of all timetables .

        edited later on.
        Several pre-set timetables are included in the solution. They are set on different weekdays, so if you want a
        simulation to
        show traffic for the weekend, choose the appropriate timetable.</p>

        as is or edit to customize it.
        You can edit, delete or create a new location.
        When you set up a new simulation, you get the option of working on a location for the simulation. If you choose
        to use a location, a
        predefined working area with nodes will be set up for you. If you choose not to use a location your working are
        will be empty.</p>

        to fill in depending on the node.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Bus and train will only demand a timetable to be connected.</li>
        <li>Terminal and bagdrop will demand information on how long it takes a passenger to enter, and if you want to
            make a single instance of the node, or
            include more in the area of the node.
        </li>
        <li>Door only requires processing time.</li>
        <li>There is also possible to add traffic by adding people this represents a group of people arriving at the

        that should walk in that direction. If you do not enter anything the percentage will be set to equal of all the
        different
        directions the passenger can go from the node selected.
        You can set amount of traffic between nodes by hovering over the line connecting two nodes, and dragging to the
        left or right in the tooltip.

    <h3 id="info-short-commands">5. Short commands:</h3>
    <p>To move a node you simply drag it around the area. There is also possible to zoom on the working area by scrolling on it
        and drag it too move around.To select a node or edge to simply click it, this also makes it possible to copy a node by pressing Ctrl + C and Ctrl + V.
        If you want to delete a node or a dependency you can simply select it and press Shift + del.
