    <p>In the simulations tab you can see a list of all previous simulation.
        Click on simulation name to view simulation results. You can also delete, edit, share and set password on the simulations.
        Passwords are set by clicking on the "lock-icon", and are used to prevent other users of the system to change your simulation.

    <img src="img/TimetableTab.PNG" alt="timetable tab" id="info-timetables" width="150px" style="margin-bottom: 10px">
    <p>In the timetables tab you can see a list of all timetables .
        Click on timetable name to edit timetable. You can also create new timetables and delete them.
        Timetables has to values, the time the bus/train arrives, and how many passengers that arrives. Both can be edited later on.
        Several pre-set timetables are included in the solution. They are set on different weekdays, so if you want a simulation to
        show traffic for the weekend, choose the appropriate timetable.

    <img src="img/LocationsTab.PNG" alt="locations tab" id="info-locations"  width="150px" style="margin-bottom: 10px">
    <p>In the presets tab you can see a list of all locations. A location is a pre-defined simulation that you can run as is or edit to customize it.
        You can edit, delete or create a new location.
        When you set up a new simulation, you get the option of working on a location for the simulation. If you choose to use a location, a
        predefined working area with nodes will be set up for you. If you choose not to use a location your working are will be empty.

    <p>Right click on the screen to add a new item. You will then get a radial menu where you can choose which type of node
        you want to add. A popup for entering information for the node will then be presented. There are different input-fields
        to fill in depending on the node.</p>
        <img src="img/radialmeny.png" alt="radialmeny" width="200px">
            <li>Bus and train will only demand a timetable to be connected.</li>
            <li>Terminal and bagdrop will demand information on how long it takes a passenger to enter, and if you want to make a single instance of the node, or
                include more in the area of the node.
            </li>
            <li>Door only requires prosessing time.</li>
            <li>There is also possible to add traffic by adding people this represents a group of people arriving at the airport. This require you to
            to fill out how many passangers are arriving, and at what intervals the traffic are comming.
            </li>

    <p>To create a direction for the passengers to go, you click shift + drag
        from an item to another item. You will then be able to enter in how many percent of the passengers
        that should walk in that direction. If you do not enter anything the percentage will be set to equal of all the different
        directions the passenger can go from the node selected.
        You can set amount of traffic between nodes by hovering over the line connecting two nodes, and dragging to the left or right in the tooltip.
